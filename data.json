    "description": "Met the team and started the CSM project that was asigned to us. Our mentor conducted a meeting to discuss the project and the tasks that we need to do. They showed us around the office and introduced us to the team. We were given a tour of the office and were shown the different departments and their jobs. They actually took the time to introduce us to all the different departments. The whole experience was really informative, but more than that, it was inspiring. We felt like we were part of something big. And with the support of our new team, we were ready to roll up our sleeves and dive into the project. "
